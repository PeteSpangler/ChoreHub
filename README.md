# ChoreHub
## Chore Management System
Hi, this is my first attempt at a mobile application. The backend utilizes Django Rest-Framework and the front end is React Native.
The idea for this came from using GitHub actually, the pull request / code review flow being the inspiration for not only the name,
but the base functionality. When complete, a user will be able to sign in, create/join a household, and assign chores/update chores
as complete. What makes this unique and sets it apart from a simple to do app is the built in accountability feature of updating a
chore as complete. That must be accompanied by a photo verifying chore completion. Without that, the assigner of the chore could
refuse to accept a chore as complete. There are some additional features I would like to add, but I need a lot more time to implement it all.
